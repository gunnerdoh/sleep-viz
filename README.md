# Interactive 3D Sleep Data Visualization

This project is a WebGL-based interactive visualization built with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) that animates sleep data in 3D space. Each trail represents a night of sleep, with movement, shape, and color influenced by biometric variables such as REM, deep sleep, heart rate variability, and more.
